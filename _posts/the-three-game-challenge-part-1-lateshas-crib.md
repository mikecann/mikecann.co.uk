Well I have just finished off the first of [my three prototype games challenge](https://mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/the-three-game-challenge/) ([part two](https://mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/the-three-game-challenge-part-2-a-cunning-plan/), [part three](https://mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/the-three-game-challenge-part-3-the-family-jewels/)) that I set myself last week.

For this one I started off with an idea that I wanted to make a time-based puzzle game. Well it didn't turn out that way, also somewhere along the way I discovered an [Ebonics Translator](https://joel.net/EBONICS/Translator) so I decided I would incorporate that for a giggle.

It was good fun tho I reached a point where I think I had sufficiently prototype the game play so it was time to move onto the next game :)

Let me know what you think. If people really like it then I may turn it into a full-blown mobile game!
