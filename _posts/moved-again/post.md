Well as I have announced (rather pointlessly) every time I moved in the past, I thought I would continue the tradition by announcing that I have moved again. This time its back again to my old room in one of my previous flats, The Grand Mancehster.

<!-- more -->

As I have already done a video of this place, Ill just reuse it:

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="505" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/3FRstdlJpHE&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="505" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/3FRstdlJpHE&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

EDIT: It would appear that Youtube have removed the soundtrack to the video, so, while watching this video imagine "[Manson - Wide Open Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NgLV056kB0)" playing in the background ;)
