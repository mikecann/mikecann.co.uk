Normally when i post a big number like that its followed by the word &quot;particles&quot; but surprisingly this time it followed by the word &quot;views&quot;. Why? Well i have (probably a few days ago now) broken my 1 million plays cherry on 4 flash games.<!-- more -->

To be fair the majority of these have come from my latest game IcySlicy (670k and counting), but im still pretty proud of the number. Im hoping my next game will do over a million by itself, but then again it could just get two plays :P
