Im proud to announce that Mr Nibbles is now available [on Blackberry App World](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/133542/?lang=en) :)

<!-- more -->

Thanks to the cross-platform nature of Haxe and NME it was actually really easy to do. Just a matter of changing a single word on the command-line: "nme build blackberry" and that was it, everything just worked out of the box!

I want to give a massive thanks to [Joshua Granick](https://www.joshuagranick.com/blog/) for helping with some of the strange certification issues I was getting. Joshua also very kindly helped test the blackberry build out on his Playbook before very kindly asking RIM to ship one out to test on myself.

Joshua also recently written a blog post on the Blackberry developer blog highlighting the awesomeness of NME and its ability to target Blackberry devices natively:

He was also kind enough to mention Mr Nibbles in the post :)

So that means Mr Nibbles is now available on the Web, Android, iOS and Blackberry. I wonder where it can go next!
