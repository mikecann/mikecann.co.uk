I made some small [heavily requested](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/reviews/487541) updates to [Particle Playground](https://www.mikecann.blog/?p=384) last night, control C, control V log:

<!-- more -->

v1.0.3 (18/03/09)

- Added this new popup at the start
- Removed system reset on every setting change
- Added Simulation settings

So far the game has been doing well on Newgrounds with a current score of <span id="submission_score">3.95</span> <span class="gray">/</span> 5.00 and and average review score of 9.5 / 10 it has managed to win the <span class="white"> Daily 4th Place</span> â€“ 03<span class="gray">/</span>19<span class="gray">/</span>2009 :)

On a related note I came accross this on twitter yesterday: [https://www.unitzeroone.com/blog/2009/03/18/flash-10-massive-amounts-of-3d-particles-with-alchemy-source-included/](https://www.unitzeroone.com/blog/2009/03/18/flash-10-massive-amounts-of-3d-particles-with-alchemy-source-included/) it blew my head, there I thought I was being clever getting 20-40k of particles in 2D and this guy has managed 300k in 3D! Ive already started work dissecting the code so that I can improve PP some ;)

Oh also so far I have been very impressed with some of the pictures being created by people, so far there have been [157 of them](https://picasaweb.google.com/mike.cann/ParticlePlayground#)! Some highlights include:
