For the last 30 days me and some friends have been taking one photo [every single day](https://twitter.com/#!/mikeysee).

<!-- more -->

Why? No reason other than we can really. We did it a [couple of years back](https://picasaweb.google.com/mike.cann/1Photo1Month) and it was good fun, so thought it would be worth repeating :)

You can see a rather nice slideshow of all the images which I have uploaded to my [Web Album](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/myphotos).

I took each one using Instagram for the iPhone so all of them can also be found on my [Instagrid](https://instagrid.me/mikeysee/).

I really enjoyed it although I must admit it was hard to find something worth photographing each day. I also wish I was better at taking pictures, but perhaps now I have a good camera Ill learn.
