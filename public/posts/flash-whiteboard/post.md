The flash whiteboard is a little experiment i cooked up in a couple of days. It basically allows the user to 'hand write' a message which is then saved on the server. Once done you can then [view the list of messages](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?page_id=131). The whiteboard was written in flash and php was used to communicate with the server.

Or if you dont want to leave a message you can just [view the messages left by others](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?page_id=131).
