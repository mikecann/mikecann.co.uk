We were asked to re-create          an old game using the newly learnt DarkBASIC programming language. I decided          to re-create the classic "Snake" game.</font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTE : I          seem to have misplaced the latest version of this game, and hence it is          missing several features and sounds. If i find it i will put it up </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">**

Used:** DarkBASIC, PhotoShop 7 **
