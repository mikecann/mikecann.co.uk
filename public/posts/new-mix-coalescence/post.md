Wow! Well this one was a hell of alot easier to make than [the last one](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=582).

<!-- more -->

Instead of trying to tell a story with film samples and a large overarching theme I have instead just let this one naturally progress and take its course. The consequence of this, I think anyway, the transitions are alot softer and more natural giving a good easy listen.

I have called this one "Coalescence" as it contains a rather different mixture of tracks that I have coalesced together. It still has that chilled-downtempo IDM-esq sound that I love so much at the moment with tracks by Jon Hopkins, Trifonic but I have also included some other tracks I have acquired on my eclectic audio adventures.

Anyways I hope you enjoy it, I think its probably my best mix since my Harmonics [1](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/audio/personal-mixes/artificial-harmonics-part-1/) and [2](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/audio/personal-mixes/artificial-harmonics-part-2/).
