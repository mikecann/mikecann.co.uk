<td>Artificial2 is my very first piece of artwork and is the result of a tutorial i followed. At the time i couldnt work out why the bloodcell in the foreground was all squarey, so i decided to make the blood green and call it "artificial" blood. This is where the name for my entire collection of art and games has stemmed from.
