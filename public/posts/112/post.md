This is the second of my experimments into flash particles, i wanted to do a whole load more of these but ran out of time. Perhaps ill pick it up again this summer.

<!-- more -->

This one uses a bitmap image and my particle system to create a fuzzy effect by constrictiong each particle to its birth site. I was planning on havig these words "explode" and the next word formed out of the remenants of the previous word, but as you can see im halfway there :P [Here](https://www.mikecann.blog/wp-content/uploads/Flash/pFont.swf) is the swf.
