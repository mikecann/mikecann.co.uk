title: Mr Nibbles Forever - Available on Android Again!
---

Just a quick one and some good news on the nibbles front since the horror story that was my [Google Play debacle](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/misc/why-i-probably-wont-be-making-another-mobile-game-ever-again/).

My PC publisher for Mr Nibbles Forever and good friends over at [Black Shell Media](https://blackshellmedia.com/) have very kindly decided to publish the Android version of [Mr Nibbles Forever to the store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackshellmedia.mrnibblesforever). This is great news as the game I spent so long developing, working on and promoting is once again available for others to enjoy.

<!-- more -->

So I want to say a massive thankyou to Raghav and the others at [Black Shell Media](https://blackshellmedia.com/).

So what are you waiting for, [go download it now](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackshellmedia.mrnibblesforever)!
