title: My Flat!
---

Well i have now found a new job at a company called Dubit in Leeds, it looks to be an excellent company, looking forward to working there.

<!-- more -->

But it also means that i have to go flat hunting again and I have to leave this excellent flat behind :( To help Michelle out with finding a replacement for me i have decided to <span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";">resurrect </span>this video to show others.

So if you are interested in this flat smack bang in the centre of Mancheter then send either me ([mike.cann@gmail.com](https://mike.cann@gmail.com)) or Michelle ([m_blenkharn@hotmail.com](mailto:m_blenkharn@hotmail.com)) an email.
