![](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Image/RM01.png)Well in my final year at university we have been working on shaders. I decided to concentrate on particles as it ties in nicely with my final project (more on that to come).

This is my first little dabble with the excellent shader creation tool, RenderMonkey. To view this you will need to [download ](https://ati.amd.com/developer/rendermonkey/downloads.html)the free app.

This was acually a peice of work for one of my modules so the .zip file contains the written report too.
