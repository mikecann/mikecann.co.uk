![](https://www.chillblast.com/images//d_5645.jpg)Well i bought my new shiny PC two weeks ago a nice quad core Q6000 machine with an nVidia 8800GTX. All was good and nice, progress on liero was flying along. The machine didnt even flinch at 1,000,000 particles, i conservatively estimate its capable of 5,000,000 at 30FPS.&nbsp; But just the other day it broke down, no reason, no warning, the mobo just went put. It turns on, the lights come on but it doesnt do anything, doesnt even get to the bios screen, nothing.<o:p></o:p>

Whats odd about this is the fact that my backup PC (some crappy little machine i have lying around and have been using as a media PC recently) broke on the same day, with the same problem! It too wont get to the bios screen even tho it turns on and the fans work. <o:p></o:p>

Anyways, the long of the short is, i sent my new PC back on Tuesday, hopefully, if they are quick it will be back tomorrow and I can resume work on LieroXNA. It annoying as i was really starting to make progress with getting it working on the 360! Stay tuned for a video of this once i get my PC back up and running.

In the meantime here is a link to a litte something my work mate pete is working on: [https://www.virtualmind.co.uk/?page_id=84](https://www.virtualmind.co.uk/?page_id=84)
