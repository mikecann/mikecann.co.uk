Just a quick update to my Chrome Crawler extension for chrome this afternoon after I received an email from Vinit Agrawal who had spotted and fixed a bug in the code :)

<!-- more -->

This is likely to be the last update of Chrome Crawler in its current form. Im currently working on a HaXe version of the extension which I hope will be better!

Anyways, it should update automatically but if not head over to the extension page: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amjiobljggbfblhmiadbhpjbjakbkldd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amjiobljggbfblhmiadbhpjbjakbkldd)
