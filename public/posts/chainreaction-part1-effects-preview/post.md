Okay its project presenting time again. This time its a biggie, its my final year main module, 60 credits of year-long projectness (not a word i know).

<!-- more -->

Well its almost getting to the end of the project and i thought i would release bits and bobs as they are finished.

A full description of what the project is and what it does will follow but for now in this post im going to show off a few of the example particle effects that have been created with the tool then exported out using the inbuilt GIF exporter.

You will have to excuse how slow the GIFs run. For some reason i cant get the frame delay any lower than about 10ms, any suggestions?
