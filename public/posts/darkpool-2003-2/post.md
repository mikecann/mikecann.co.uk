![](/wp-content/uploads/Image/darkpool.gif)<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DarkPOOL was created as a project for one of my first year university modules. It was created primarily as a test into the physics of pool. The game is in 3D however the main camera view is directly over the top of the table giving a 2D appearance.</font>

<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTE: Unfortuanately i have lost the latest version of this game and hence it doesnt play as well as it should, the physics worked properly in the full version :)</font>
