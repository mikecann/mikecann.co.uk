Well its been quite a while since my last progress report. I have mostly been sleeping (well 4 hours of it anyways).

<!-- more -->

So progress is coming along nicely STILL no gameplay tho :S

So far you can shoot and destroy the enemies and then collect thier giblets before they become part of the terrain. The idea is that you can then shoot those giblets back at the enemies. Take alook if you are interested:

<object style="width: 600px; height: 500px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="600" height="500" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="https://www.mikecann.co.uk/DumpingGround/ld/18/04/LudumDare18.swf" /><embed style="width: 600px; height: 500px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="500" src="https://www.mikecann.co.uk/DumpingGround/ld/18/04/LudumDare18.swf"></embed></object>

Oh I just noticed I left some debug sliders on there I was using to try and hone the bloom levels. Have a play with them if you want.

Right. Gameplay.
