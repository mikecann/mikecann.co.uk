Just a quick update to [my first chrome extension](https://mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/my-first-chrome-extension-post-to-tumblr/).

<!-- more -->

Following a request someone left in the comments I have now added an option to set how the post should be published. So now you can choose whether you want your cat with a lime on its head to be posted to your drafts or your queue or simply to your default wall.

You can grab the new version in the usual place on the Chrome Extensions Gallery -&gt;[ https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah?hl=en)

I think it updates by its itself, but I cant be sure!

Enjoy!
