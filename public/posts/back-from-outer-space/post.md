title: Back From Outer Space
---

.. well California actually but im just listening to abit of Prodigy so I thought it appropriate.

Was over for just over two weeks, hired a car with [Toni ](https://www.littlemisstoni.co.uk/)and went-a-road-trippin. First few days were down the coast from San Francisco down the Big Sur to LA. Then from LA accross to Vegas, then all the way back again.

<!-- more -->

Apart from a parking ticket (who knew you have to park in the same direction traffic is flowing?!) everything went pretty smooth. Toni is still over there, will be for the next 6 weeks, hitting the research with the very clever physics bods over at [Berkly Universit](https://berkeley.edu/)y.

As usual the holiday snaps can be found on my [Picassa Web Albums page](https://picasaweb.google.com/mike.cann/California10#), but here are some highlights:
