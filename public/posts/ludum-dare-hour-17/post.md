Okay its been about 6 hours since my last update, and I have been working pretty much solid apart from an hour lunchbreak when I went for a wander into town.

<!-- more -->

Ive made quite abit of progress with the core bits of the engine including the physics particle systems and the destructible terrain.

Dont believe me? Take a look for yourself:

Theres still no game really, just a pretty tech demo. Im hoping the gameplay will come next :)

Im going to have abit of a break now, get some food wind down a little then its going to be a loooooong night ahead for me!
