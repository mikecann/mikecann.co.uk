Well I have just finished off the first of [my three prototype games challenge](/posts/the-three-game-challenge/) ([part two](/posts/the-three-game-challenge-part-2-a-cunning-plan/), [part three](/posts/the-three-game-challenge-part-3-the-family-jewels/)) that I set myself last week.

<!-- more -->

For this one I started off with an idea that I wanted to make a time-based puzzle game. Well it didn't turn out that way, also somewhere along the way I discovered an [Ebonics Translator](https://joel.net/EBONICS/Translator) so I decided I would incorporate that for a giggle.

Anyways see what you think:

In total I spent 31 hours over the last week making this over the past week:

26th March
3pm - 5pm

27th March
10am - 12pm
1pm - 5pm

28th March
10am - 11:30am
3pm - 8pm

29th March
2pm - 5pm

1st April
2pm - 6pm

2nd April
8am - 12pm
2pm - 3pm
5pm - 8pm

3rd April
9:30am - 10:30am
12:pm - 1pm

It was good fun tho I reached a point where I think I had sufficiently prototype the game play so it was time to move onto the next game :)

Let me know what you think. If people really like it then I may turn it into a full-blown mobile game!
