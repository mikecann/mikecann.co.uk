title: Redundency is Great
---

Well thats it for my time at Rockpool Games.

Since friday the 28th of March Eidos (owners of Rockpool Games) are making thier mobile department redundant.

<!-- more -->

Its not all doom and gloom however as we all have 90 days remaining fully paid and redundency payments ontop of that, so as today is the first day since the news broke on friday we have been doing very little. I have even had time to build myself a little fort and declare myself the ruler of of this part of the office.
