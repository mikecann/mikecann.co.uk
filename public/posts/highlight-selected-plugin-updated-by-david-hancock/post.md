This sort of things brings a big smile to my face; I got an excellent email yesterday from a chap named [Dave Hancock](https://gonegothic.com/) asking my permission to post an update he had made to my [Highlight Selected](https://www.mikecann.blog/?p=403) plugin.

<!-- more -->

Its an excellent upgrade and brings some extra features that were lacking in my very basic version.

**Copy / Paste of his update:**

Liked the plugin so much I decided to add a few features! Posting here with Mike's permission.
