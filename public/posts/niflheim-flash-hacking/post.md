title: Niflheim & Flash Hacking

Stumbled accross this thing just now. I have heard of this method of flash hacking, but I didnt realise it was so easy to do nor people had actually made special applications to do it!

<object width="480" height="392" data="https://flash.revver.com/player/1.0/player.swf?mediaId=855160&amp;affiliate=34929" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="id" value="revver85516012404869925462841" /><param name="Movie" value="https://flash.revver.com/player/1.0/player.swf?mediaId=855160&amp;affiliate=34929" /><param name="FlashVars" value="allowFullScreen=true" /><param name="AllowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="AllowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="allowFullScreen=true" /><param name="src" value="https://flash.revver.com/player/1.0/player.swf?mediaId=855160&amp;affiliate=34929" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object>

I guess I need to think of ways of hiding these critical variables within my code, or perform some sort of sanity checks perhaps.

EDIT: Quasimondo on Twitter informs me that "[The Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org/index.php)" appears to be the default tool of the trade for flash memory hacking.
