<p>Been a while since I have posted about LieroXNA but I havent been doing nothing. Changes and things:

<!-- more -->

- Added a destroyed layer to the game which is just the initial map but darker.

- Added a shadow to the foreground to give it a more 3D appearence.

- Added an indestructable layer, so that maps can have abit of structure even after a long battle.

- Added the ability to zoom in and out. This was a big one and took most of last weekend to sort out.

- Added player spawning.

- Added the ability to control the player with the 360 controller.

- Started to add other gameplay features such as player jumps, crosshair, weapon switching things and others.
