title: 'BlastWave: Lost at Sea'
---

FINALLY ITS LIVE!!!! Oh my, it has taken literally[ months and months](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/the-next-one-blast-wave-2/) to get all the deals sorted but finally now its done and out.

Its [Oliver ](https://www.olip.co.uk/)and my latest game. It was supposed to be a quick re-skin of [BlastWave](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/flash/blast-wave/), but as usual "quick" was a word that got lost during development as we got excited about it and decided to add more and more features.

The Art by [Oliver Pitceathly](https://www.olip.co.uk/) follows a simmilar style to [MonkeyMines](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/monkey-mines/). Hope you like it!
