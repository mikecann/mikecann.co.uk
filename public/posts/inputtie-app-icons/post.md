With the beta for Inputtie drawing very near Oli and I are adding some final touches to the build and doing those "things we meant to do for ages".  One of those things being the app icon. This is the icon you will see on your shortcuts and in your taskbar area so its going to be pretty visible.

Oli, my partner-in-crime has whipped up 2 different versions with 2 variations on each version. See what you think:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/square_304x304.png "square_304x304")](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/square_304x304.png)[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/squareborder_304x304.png "squareborder_304x304")](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/squareborder_304x304.png)

I personally am favouring the circle icon with the border, however I worry that it looks too much like the Internet Explorer icon.

What do you all think?
