I was just looking through my last few posts and realized that I hadn't mentioned yet that [Mr Nibbles Forever](https://epicshrimp.com/app/mrnibblesforever/) is coming to the Desktop!

<!-- more -->

I few months ago I decided that I wanted to see if a publisher would be interested in helping me take some of the tedious marketing responsibilities for the game off my hands and publish the game for me. I contacted a couple of recommended publishers and heard back almost immediately from [Black Shell Media](https://blackshellmedia.com/). After a little back and forth I struck a deal with them to publish the game on PC, Mac and Linux via Steam, Good old Games, bundles and various other channels they have access to.

So for the past months I have been tweaking the controls and UI for PC and adding more content and features which I will speak about more in a later post.

Along the way BSM added the game to the Steam Greenlight process ([https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=605120650](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=605120650)) and as of Friday it was finally given the thumbs up by the community to join the other games on Steam :D

So there are a few more steps that we need to take before the game is ready to buy such as completing the all important store page but hopefully it shouldn't be too long.

Stay tuned to this blog or on the games [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/mrnibblesforever/) for more infos!
