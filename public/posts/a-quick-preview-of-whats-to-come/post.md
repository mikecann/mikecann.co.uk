Well here is one of the first outputs from the new tool i am developing for my university final year project. Its designed to be a little advert for a mini-game which i have also created.

Edit: For some reason wordpress doesnt like it so go to [this ](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/flash/winter.html)link to see it.
