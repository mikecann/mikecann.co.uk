title: Old flash tutorial

This is an old piece of flash from an age ago. Its kinda a 2-parter, the first part is a sig i made for the forums over at my [clans website](https://www.clan1.co.uk). The second part is a tutorial i did shortly after making the sig. I got a couple of requests of how i made such a thing so i decided to write a very basic flash tutorial. Remember this is quite old so the flash version is a little out of date.
