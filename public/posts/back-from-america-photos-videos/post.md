Hello All!

Yes im now back from the good old U.S. of A. Had an awsome time, many exciting things seen many exciting things done and many interesting people met.

<!-- more -->

Best sight of the trip: Hard to say, everything was pretty damn amazing but if I absolutely had to single out one memorable event it must be camping out under the stars in the navajo homelands.

Craziest sight of the trip: Seeing a bloke with no legs front-flip out of his wheelchair..

Anyways, I have so many pictures and videos I had to buy an upgrade for my picassa account. But this upgrade now means I can upload videos to picassa, yey!

Go check out the photos on my picassa account [HERE](https://picasaweb.google.com/mike.cann/AmericaPhotos07). Some highlights include:
