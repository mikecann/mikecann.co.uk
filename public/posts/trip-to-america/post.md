![](https://www.trekamerica.com/images/map_w3.jpg)This will be my last post for a while as im going on a 24day holiday to America on Tuesday. Im going with my old school mate Ben and we will be hitting the west coast on a large 21 day camping trip with the group Trek America.

<!-- more -->

It should be awesome, going to visit all the main national parks on the Midwest of the US and alot of the main cities too :D

Anyways, I may be checking my email when we arrive in the cities, I may not, so dont expect any instant reply from emails while im away.
