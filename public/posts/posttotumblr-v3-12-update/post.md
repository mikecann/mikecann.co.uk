I have finally found some time to do a long overdue update to my popular Chrome extension [PostToTumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah) built using Haxe. 30,000 people currently have the extension installed and they post about 10,000 images, links, quotes per day so I thought it was about time to give it some love.

<!-- more -->

The list of improvements are:

- One-Click posting now available in the options
- Tall images now no longer appear off the screen
- Notifications now used instead of popups
- Improved error detection
- Improved authorization process

The main feature in the update is the one-click posting. This much-requested feature was available in the original PostToTumblr but for various reasons never made it into the latest reincarnation.

Once enabled in the options it enables the user to bypass the post preformatting window that usually pops up and instead posts with some default settings. If you have more than one blog the post menu gives you the option for which blog you would like the post to go to:

The normal popup "posting.." window has been replaced with HTML5 notifications.

This should make posting a smoother, less intrusive process.

If you haven't got the extension already you can grab it on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah) else Chrome should auto-update the extension for you very soon!
