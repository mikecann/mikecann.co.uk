title: Domains..

Noticed yesterday that [https://www.particleplayground.com](https://www.particleplayground.com) was available so it got my thought train going. I wonder if...

<!-- more -->

The first step, [as someone pointed out](https://www.twitter.com/6t8), was to buy the domain. So I am now the proud owner of [https://www.particleplayground.com](https://www.particleplayground.com) and [https://www.particleplayground.co.uk](https://www.particleplayground.co.uk), yey for me!

I probably wont do anything with them but you never know!
