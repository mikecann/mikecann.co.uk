title: Mikes Mirror - The Talk
---

After my many [hard-learnt-lessons](/projects/mikes-mirror-overview/) building a Smart Mirror the past few months, I decided it might be a good idea to share some of those lessons with others in the community.

# The Talk

At the start of the year I gave [a different talk](talks/a-game-developer-learns-machine-leaning-then-talks-about-it/) at the local Machine Learning Meetup group about my very basic explorations of Machine Learning in game development and it went well and the audience was receptive to non ML-heavy talks so I thought it would be a good place to talk about my mirror project although it wasnt strictly Machine Learning focused, it did involve using some off-the-shelf face recognition and audio recognition ML tools.

I produced a slide deck from my previous condensed blogposts on the topic:

1. [Mikes Mirror - Overview](projects/mikes-mirror-overview/)

2. [Mikes Mirror - Hardware](projects/mikes-mirror-hardware/)

3. [Mikes Mirror - Software](/projects/mikes-mirror-software/)

If you are interested the [slides are available](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nD3MhRzxJPYn63N_mdyxkSFqVFoFneQpcYXBlVICJEE/edit?usp=sharing) and the published show is here:

The talk went really well. Everyone had a bit of a laugh and I think learnt a little bit about what it takes to build a small IoT device, so im really glad I did it.
