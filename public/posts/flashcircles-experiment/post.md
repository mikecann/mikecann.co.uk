I was in the pub yesterday with Toni and some friends and we saw a painting on the wall that was compleately made up of circles of various sizes with varying borders and none of the circles overlapped.

<!-- more -->

Well Toni and i got into a discussion of how it could be done in code. I suggested it could be done via a brute force method, she dissagreed and thought that a more mathimatical approch would be better.

Well i decided to have a stab at it this afternoon. Its definately not perfect, but it does create circles tightly packed with no overlapping.

Can anyone do any better?
