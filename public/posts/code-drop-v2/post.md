title: Code Drop V2

CodeDrop came about mainly by accident. I wanted to see if i could create a 2D particle explosion effect. After i discovered how easy this was to do i decided to create a whole game around it!

The game is now in its second version, and has many new improvements over the last, check it out, tell me what you think.</span>
