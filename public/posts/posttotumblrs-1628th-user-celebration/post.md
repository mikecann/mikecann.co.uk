To celebrate the 1,628th user of my Chrome extension [PostToTumblr](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah) I have just uploaded a new version that adds a requested feature.

<!-- more -->

The new feature allows the user to post to multiple Tumblr blogs.

Once specified in the options you are now presented with a sub-menu when posting images allowing you to choose your alternative blogs or just the default blog:

Important to note is that you are only presented this sub-menu if you have specified alternative blogs in the options.

Chrome should auto-update the extension for you soon!
